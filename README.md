## Installation instructions

1. Clone this directory into any folder (I use .config/zsh usually) and copy the .zshrc file to your home directory.
2. Create a new zsh session or `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the config.
3. You should see it install any missing dependencies (lmk if I missed any!) and ensure your plugins are loaded.
