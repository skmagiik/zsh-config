## Installation instructions

1. Clone this directory into any folder (I use .config/zsh usually)
2. Copy the .zshrc file to your home directory: `cp .zshrc ~/.zshrc`
2. Copy the starship.toml file to your config directory: `cp starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml`
2. Create a new zsh session or `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the config.
3. You should see it install any missing dependencies (lmk if I missed any!) and ensure your plugins are loaded.
